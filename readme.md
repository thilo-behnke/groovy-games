# About

2D Game Engine written in Groovy.  

# Features

- 2D Collision Detection
- Custom dependency injection framework
- Largely environment independent, e.g. by using adapter classes for canvas implementations and mouse/key listeners.  
- Modular design that enforces reuse, e.g. using the same interfaces for keyboard and ai controlled game objects.
- Groovy AST transformations generate boilerplate code

# How to run

Demos / sample games can be run using `./gradlew runGame`.

# TODO

- Physics Engine
- Tile based level system (e.g. using tiled)
- DSL for creating games
